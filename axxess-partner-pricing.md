## Vuma Reach Payment Process

### How Vuma Reach Billing Works

We provide simple, flexible billing options

#### Monthly Billing

**Initial Purchase**
When you first buy the service, you pay the full monthly price. This covers your first full month of service.

**First Renewal**
On your first renewal, you'll pay a pro rata (partial) amount to cover the days from your activation date to the start of your regular billing cycle.

**Ongoing Renewals**
After that, you'll be charged the full monthly price on a regular schedule.

#### Prepaid Voucher

**30 Days of Service**
Each voucher provides 30 days of service, starting from the day your service is installed and activated by Vuma Reach.

**Initial Activation**
Your first 30 days start automatically when your service is activated, as the first voucher is automatically redeemed.

**Additional Vouchers**
Any extra vouchers you buy will add another 30 days each.

You can buy up to 6 vouchers at a time:
- 1 voucher = 30 days
- 3 vouchers = 90 days
- 6 vouchers = 180 days

**Keep Your Service Active**
To avoid service suspension, make sure to buy new vouchers before your current voucher window ends.

### Monthly Packages

A payment card is required to set up your monthly payment.

We'll automatically deduct your service fee each month, so you don't have to worry about remembering to pay manually.

### Prepaid Packages

This is a pay-as-you-go option.

You'll need to make a payment every 30 days to stay connected.

We offer several convenient ways for you to pay.
