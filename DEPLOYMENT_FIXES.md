# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing CSS Files
- **Issue**: Build was failing due to missing CSS imports
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/components/common/LTEPackageSummary.css` - Styles for LTE package summary component
  - `src/pages/LTESignupPage.css` - Styles for LTE signup page

### 2. Missing API Functions
- **Issue**: `submitLTEApplication` function was missing from API service
- **Fix**: Added `submitLTEApplication` function to `src/services/api.js`
- **Updated**: Default export to include the new function

### 3. Missing Route Configuration
- **Issue**: LTESignupPage was not configured in routing
- **Fix**: Added import and route for LTESignupPage in `src/App.js`

## Build Status
âœ… **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - The application now builds without errors

## Current Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Some unused variables in components
- Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
- Anonymous default export in api.js

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel or any other hosting platform.

## Environment Variables Needed
For production deployment, set these environment variables:
- `REACT_APP_WP_API_URL=https://starcast.co.za/wp-json`
- `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
2. Configure environment variables in hosting platform
3. Test all functionality in production
4. Optional: Fix remaining ESLint warnings for code quality
